songbook-web
============

Web interface for songbook generation (see https://github.com/crep4ever/songbook or http://www.patacrep.com/fr/index.php)

## How to run

Be sure you have Python and Django (1.6.1) installed.

Then you can run a development server with the command `python manage.py runserver`. No web server (e.g. Apache, ...) required.

You can may fill db with some data using on of the fixture files, like : `./manage.py loaddata generator/fixtures/few_songs.json`

## This is a development version !

And it is not usable yet ! Lot of things just don't work. Check the wiki to know what's missing.
